# Theming going forward
To simplify this project, we are going to use a Theme Provider that will allow easy theming of the project.

## Theme Provider
Inside the theme provider should find the ability to set the theme

## Project Configuration
We have custom colors that must be added in all projects configuration files, to properly use the colors

### This includes:
* Primary Color
* Secondary Color
* Accent Color
* Background Color
* Variant 
    * Rounded
    * Default
    * Outline
